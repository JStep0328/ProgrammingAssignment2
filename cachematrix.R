## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
## repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will
## not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that
## cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object
## that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
            x <<- y
            m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() solve(x)
        setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
        getmean <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setmean = setmean,
             getmean = getmean)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special
## "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
## already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
## `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getmean()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- mean(data, ...)
    x$setmean(m)
    m    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
